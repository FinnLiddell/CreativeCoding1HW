One of the things that affected me the most in The Last Lecture was Randy Pausch’s idea that obstacles are there to test how much we really want something. He says that "brick walls" aren't meant to stop us but to show our determination. This made me think about challenges in my own life and how they have pushed me to work harder instead of giving up. I also connected with his message about helping others achieve their dreams. He believed that supporting others is just as important as reaching our own goals. This stood out to me because I enjoy creative work, and I hope to use my skills to inspire and help others in the future. His lecture reminded me that success isn’t just about personal achievement—it’s also about making a difference for others.
