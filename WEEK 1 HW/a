A CLI (Command-Line Interface) and a GUI (Graphical User Interface) are basicly two different ways to use a computer. A CLI is text-based where you type commands into a terminal to tell the computer what to do. Itâ€™s fast and precise but requires you to remember the correct commands, making it harder for beginners. On the other hand, a GUI is visual and uses icons and menus that you can click on with a mouse. GUIs are easier to learn and more user-friendly but can be slower and need more computer power. People often use CLIs for advanced tasks while GUIs are better for everyday use.
